# Diploma Thesis Repository: Cheminformatics Analysis of RNA binding ligands

Welcome to the repository for my diploma thesis. This project explores ensemble and graph neural network (GNN) models applied to cheminformatics data. The repository includes  documentation, code, and data resources aimed at researchers and students in machine learning and cheminformatics.

## Data

The raw and ML datasets for set1 and set2 are hosted externally due to their size. You can access them via the following link: [Dataset Link](https://owncloud.cesnet.cz/index.php/s/juPLpmojqktq0IU).

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this research is to develop, train, and evaluate advanced machine learning models, focusing specifically on:

- Ensemble learning techniques for molecular classification.
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular classification.

### Key Contributions

1. **Novel Model Architectures**: Implementation of unique GNN and ensemble architectures tailored to cheminformatics data.
2. **Dataset Curation**: Comprehensive pre-processing and curation of diverse molecular datasets.
3. **Performance evaluation**: Rigorous model evaluation through various performance metrics and visualizations.
